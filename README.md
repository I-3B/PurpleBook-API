# PurpleBook-API
## About
A Facebook clone application. 

I built it with Express and MongoDB for the backend and React for the [frontend](https://github.com/I-3B/PurpleBook-client), I used Typescript for both.

It was the final project for [theodinproject.com](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript) Full-stack JavaScript course, the task was just to build a Facebook with the core features (posts, likes, comments, friends).

It took me a lot of time because of college exams and other stuff. 

I learned a lot in this project, those are some points:
### for the backend:
- first time using Typescript for backend, it helped a lot and I will never use untyped JavaScript again
- first time I write tests for an API (around 200 test) and I think I will never write an API without tests in the future
- I used Oauth2 (login with Facebook)
- I got better in writing MongoDB queries (friend recommendation was kind of challenging) 
- I made custom middlewares for authorization   
### for the frontend:
- I tried to make components reusable as often as I can (cards, buttons, a hook for paged lists) 
- I used SCSS features (extending classes, variables, partials) 
- I used useRef hook for passing data between components  I wrote many Typescripts interfaces and It benefited me a good deal 

 that's it, I guess!
